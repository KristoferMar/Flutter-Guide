# Flutter-Guide
This project provides you with best practice flutter development and code snippets.

## Basic information
Flutter uses the Flutter Framework with a set of features and we use Dart as the programming language to code apps in flutter. Flutter uses the Fluter SDK to compile the apps in the end.

<h3>Flutter Architecture</h3> <br> 
- Flutter uses UI as Code which means that you Build your UI in code. We use a "Widget Tree" to build an app. Flutter embraces platform differences between IOS and Android but in one base. <br>
- Flutter consists of widgets which are the same as components in frontend development. Widgets consists of other widgets and we build the app in that way. An app will result in a "Widget tree". <br>
- One codebase: you will end with a bouch of .dart files but eventually you will only use one codebase for both IOS and Android. <br>
