### Stateless vs statefull

- Statless takes in data to a widget and renders the UI. <br>
  - Some widgets are only there to output / show something.
- Stateful takes in data to a widget which changes the widgets internal state which then gets rendered in the UI. (Get's rerenderered when input data or local state changes) <br>

<h3>Important functions</h3> <br>
- .map - Maps a specific object or value into somtething else. An example of this can be foud in main.dart.
